- ‚úÖ **Real-time Updates**: Issues appear in real-time across all users
- ‚úÖ **Like System**: Users can like/unlike issues with live count updates
- ‚úÖ **Professional UI**: Consistent, modern design with proper AppBars
- ‚úÖ **Supabase Integration**: Full backend integration with authentication

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Set up Supabase Database
1. Follow the instructions in `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`
2. Create your Supabase project
3. Run the provided SQL scripts to create tables
4. Configure authentication and real-time

### Step 2: Configure Environment
Update your environment variables in `lib/core/config/env_config.dart`:

```dart
class EnvConfig {
  static const String supabaseUrl = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL';
  static const String supabaseAnonKey = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY';
}
```

### Step 3: Run the App
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## üì± App Structure

### **Main Views**
- **Services Home**: Main navigation hub with service cards
- **My Issues**: Social media-style feed of all posted issues
- **Report Issue**: Form to post new civic issues
- **Profile**: User profile management

### **Key Components**
- **ProfessionalAppBar**: Consistent, themed AppBars throughout the app
- **DynamicIssueController**: Manages real-time issue data and interactions
- **IssueServiceSupabase**: Handles all Supabase operations
- **Social Media Cards**: Professional issue display with like functionality

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Real-time Issue Posting Flow**
1. User fills out issue form
2. `DynamicIssueController.postIssue()` is called
3. Data is sent to Supabase via `IssueServiceSupabase.createIssue()`
4. Real-time subscription updates all connected clients
5. Issue appears instantly in the feed

### **Like System Implementation**
1. User taps like button
2. `DynamicIssueController.toggleLike()` is called
3. Supabase database is updated
4. Local state is updated immediately
5. Real-time updates propagate to other users

### **Professional AppBar System**
- **HomeAppBar**: For main navigation screens
- **FormAppBar**: For form screens with back navigation
- **ProfileAppBar**: For profile-related screens
- **IssueFeedAppBar**: For issue feed screens

## üìä Database Schema

### **Issues Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE issues (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'submitted',
  priority TEXT DEFAULT 'medium',
  image_url TEXT,
  location JSONB NOT NULL,
  address TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **Issue Likes Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE issue_likes (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  issue_id UUID REFERENCES issues(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(issue_id, user_id)
);
```
